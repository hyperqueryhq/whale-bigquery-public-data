# `crypto_polygon.logs`
`bq-1` | `bigquery-public-data`
Similar to the token_transfers table, the logs table contains data for smart contract events. However, it contains all log data, not only ERC20 token transfers.
This table is generally useful for reporting on any logged event type on the Polygon  blockchain.
Data is exported using https://github.com/blockchain-etl/polygon-etl

  - Integer of the log index position in the block
* [STRING]    `transaction_hash`

* [INTEGER]   `transaction_index`
  - Integer of the transactions index position log was created from
* [STRING]    `address`

  - Timestamp of the block where this log was in
