# `ebi_chembl.molecule_hierarchy_30`
`bq-1` | `bigquery-public-data`

## Column details
* [INTEGER]   `molregno`
  - Foreign key to compounds table. This field holds a list of all of the ChEMBL compounds with associated data (e.g., activity information, approved drugs). Parent compounds that are generated only by removing salts, and which do not themselves have any associated data will not appear here.
* [INTEGER]   `parent_molregno`
  - Represents parent compound of molregno in first field (i.e., generated by removing salts). Where molregno and parent_molregno are same, the initial ChEMBL compound did not contain a salt component, or else could not be further processed for various reasons (e.g., inorganic mixture). Compounds which are only generated by removing salts will appear in this field only. Those which, themselves, have any associated data (e.g., activity data) or are launched drugs will also appear in the molregno field.
* [INTEGER]   `active_molregno`
  - Where a compound is a pro-drug, this represents the active metabolite of the 'dosed' compound given by parent_molregno. Where parent_molregno and active_molregno are the same, the compound is not currently known to be a pro-drug.
