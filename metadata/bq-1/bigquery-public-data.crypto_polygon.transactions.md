# `crypto_polygon.transactions`
`bq-1` | `bigquery-public-data`
Each block in the blockchain is composed of zero or more transactions. Each transaction has a source address, a target address, an amount of Matic transferred, and an array of input bytes.
This table contains a set of all transactions from all blocks, and contains a block identifier to get associated block-specific information associated with each transaction.
Data is exported using https://github.com/blockchain-etl/polygon-etl
