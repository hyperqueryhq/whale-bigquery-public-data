A place is a business or point of interest within the world. A Place is a point representation of a real-world facility, service, or amenity.


Founded in 2022 under the Joint Development Foundation, Overture Maps Foundation (Overture Maps) is dedicated to the development of reliable, easy-to-use, and interoperable open map data that will power current and next-generation map products. We build this data through a collaborative process that combines technology, data, and support from a wide range of companies. Map data are assembled from multiple sources including members, civic organizations, and open data sources.
