* [STRING]    `wb_2_code`
  - World Bank 2 digit code value of the country.
* [STRING]    `national_accounts_base_year`
  - Base year is the base or pricing period used for constant price calculations in the country’s national accounts. Price indexes derived from national accounts aggregates, such as the implicit deflator for gross domestic product (GDP), express the price level relative to base year prices.
* [STRING]    `national_accounts_reference_year`
  - Reference year is the year in which the local currency constant price series of a country is valued. The reference year is usually the same as the base year used to report the constant price series. However, when the constant price data are chain linked, the base year is changed annually, so the data are rescaled to a specific reference year to provide a consistent time series. When the country has not rescaled following a change in base year, World Bank staff rescale the data to maintain a longer historical series. To allow for cross-country comparison and data aggregation, constant price data reported in World Development Indicators are rescaled to a common reference year (2010) and currency (U.S. dollars).
* [STRING]    `sna_price_valuation`
  - SNA price valuation shows whether value added in the national accounts is reported at basic prices (B) or producer prices (P).

However, value added can be higher at basic prices than at producer prices in countries with high agricultural subsidies.
